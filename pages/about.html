        Born and raised in Jabalpur, I am currently studying Computer Science
        and Engineering with a specialization in Front-End Development at
        Badaria Global Institute of Engineering and Management. As a web
        enthusiast and curious learner, I enjoy designing websites, exploring
        creative layouts, and developing smart solutions that improve digital
        experiences. Specializing in front-end development, I transform ideas
        into visually appealing, Interactive, and user-friendly websites. I
        create intuitive Interfaces and engaging web pages that combine clean
        design with functional elements. My academic journey has equipped me
        with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, along with
        a growing foundation in UI/UX design principles.
